# Seattle-Assessment

## Summary
This is a private repository that I created for the Seattle Aquarium's Research Technician position technical assessment. The instructions for the asessment are located within in the file named "Research_Technician_technical_interview_assignment.docx". The python script can be found within the scripts folder. All code is annotated thoroughly to demonstrate my thought process throughout each step. 

**Time To Completion**

I began the assessment around 3:00 PM PST 09/21/24 and completed the assignment at 9:00 PM PST 09/21/24. Coding took approximately 4 hours, and installing proper libraries, such as opencv, and troubleshooting took approximately 2 hours.

## Data 
The data for this assignment was too large to be pushed to this repository, but when cloning locally, users should download the '2024_03_21_14-12-23.mp4' video and '2024_03_21.csv' file and save within a data folder. This will allow for the script to run successfully. The structure of the local repository should be as follows:
